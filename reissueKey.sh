# Description
#
#	The purpose of this script is to allow a new individual recovery key to be issued
#	if the current key is invalid and the management account is not enabled for FV2,
#	or if the machine was encrypted outside of the JSS.
#
#	First put a configuration profile for FV2 recovery key redirection in place.
#	Ensure keys are being redirected to your JSS.
#
#	This script will prompt the user for their password so a new FV2 individual
#	recovery key can be issued and redirected to the JSS.
