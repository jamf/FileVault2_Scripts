#
# Description
#
# The purpose of this script is to allow a new individual recovery key to be issued
# if the current key is invalid and the management account is not enabled for FV2,
# or if the machine was encrypted outside of the JSS.
#
# First put a configuration profile for FV2 recovery key redirection in place.
# Ensure keys are being redirected to your JSS.
#
# This script will prompt the user for their password so a new FV2 individual
# recovery key can be issued and redirected to the JSS.
